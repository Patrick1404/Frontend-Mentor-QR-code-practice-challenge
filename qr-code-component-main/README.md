This is a solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor] and my very first project, I decided to take on this challenge to see if I was capable of doing it with the few programmig concepts that I've learned so far.
 I'm not sure if the CSS declarations or properties that I used are the adecuete ones to build this project, so I would really appreciate any advices. 

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- CSS positioning
